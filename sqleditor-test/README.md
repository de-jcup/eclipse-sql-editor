## About this gradle sub project

This project is only to have the possibility to have `sqleditor-plugin` testable with mockito because `sqleditor-plugin` eclipse project .classpath .project etc. is full static and not generated by gradle and we want to avoid
adding another binary lib to the git repository. So this is a workaround.
